# Blender Project - Aron Chen


## What is this project?
This project is a siumlation of how water/sludge would overflow and interact with a glass cap. One of the biggest graphic based technology used to acheive this simulation was Blender. In Blender I used a 3D box as my domain to hold my cup object and my water. A self made glass shader was created to simulate a glass cup in real life. I created the cup using a single cube and maniupulated its edges/vertices to get the desired cup design. 

To install and run this project you can download the project.blend file and open it up in blender. Once its opened in blender you can add any adjustments you want to it. Once you're satisfied click blend animation, then one its done blending, click view animation. To export it into a mp4 make sure you choose a file path in the output settings.
